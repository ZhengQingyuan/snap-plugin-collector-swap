## Getting Started

 Plugin collects specified metrics in-band on OS level

### System Requirements
 - Linux system

### Installation
#### Download the plugin binary:
You can get the pre-built binaries for your OS and architecture at snap's [Github Releases](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/releases) page.

#### To build the plugin binary:
Fork https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-swap

Clone repo into `$GOPATH/src/github/intelsdi-x/`:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/<yourGithubID>/snap-plugin-collector-swap
```
Build the plugin by running make in repo:
```
$ make
```
This builds the plugin in `/build/rootfs`

### Configuration and Usage
* Set up the [snap framework](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap/blob/master/README.md#getting-started).
* Load the plugin and create a task, see example in [Examples](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-swap/blob/master/README.md#examples).

## Documentation

### Collected Metrics
The path to the procfs can be provided in configuration as `proc_path`. If configuration is not provided, the plugin will use the default of `/proc`.

It can be set in the snap global config that is loaded with snapd, e.g.:
```json
{
    "log_level": 1,
    "control": {
        "plugin_trust_level": 0,
        "plugins": {
            "collector": {
                "swap": {
                    "all": {
                        "proc_path": "/proc"
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The list of collected metrics is described in [METRICS.md](https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-swap/blob/master/METRICS.md).

### Examples

Example running snap-plugin-collector-swap plugin and writing data to a file.

Make sure that your `$SNAP_PATH` is set, if not:
```
$ export SNAP_PATH=<snapDirectoryPath>/build
```

Other paths to files should be set according to your configuration, using a file you should indicate where it is located.

In one terminal window, open the snap daemon (in this case with logging set to 1,  trust disabled):
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapd -l 1 -t 0
```
In another terminal window:

Load snap-plugin-collector-swap plugin:
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl plugin load snap-plugin-collector-swap
```
Load file plugin for publishing:
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl plugin load $SNAP_PATH/plugin/snap-publisher-file
```
See available metrics for your system:
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl metric list
```

Create a task manifest file to use snap-plugin-collector-swap plugin (exemplary files in [examples/tasks/] (https://github.com/intelsdi-x/snap-plugin-collector-swap/blob/master/examples/tasks/)):
```json
{
    "version": 1,
    "schedule": {
        "type": "simple",
        "interval": "5s"
    },
    "workflow": {
        "collect": {
            "metrics": {
                "/intel/procfs/swap/device/*/used_bytes": {},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/device/*/used_percent": {},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/device/*/free_bytes": {},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/device/*/free_percent": {},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/all/cached_bytes": {},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/all/cached_percent":{},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/all/free_bytes":{},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/all/free_percent":{},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/all/used_bytes":{},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/all/used_percent":{},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/io/in_bytes_per_sec":{},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/io/in_pages_per_sec":{},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/io/out_bytes_per_sec":{},
                "/intel/procfs/swap/io/out_pages_per_sec":{}
            },
            "config": {},
            "process": null,
            "publish": [
                {
                    "plugin_name": "mock-file",
                    "config": {
                        "file": "/tmp/published_swap.log"
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    }
}
```
Create a task:
```
$ $SNAP_PATH/bin/snapctl task create -t swap-file.json
```
